## Inspiration
We were inspired by the bounty to use Microsoft Office in order to make a game. 
## What it does
Simply run the power point and play the game.
## How we built it
Using VBA and PowerPoint macros to make our game interactive.
## Challenges we ran into
We challenged ourselves by learning VBA, none of us had any experience with this language prior to this project. It was a lot of fun, but also very challenging.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The game is actually quite fun and challenging, I could see myself playing it for a while despite it being made completely on PowerPoint.
